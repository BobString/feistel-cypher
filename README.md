feistel-cypher
==============

First assignment of Security and Vulnerability in Networks of the master of the University of Stavanger:

In this assignment you will implement a Feistel cipher of your own design.
A Feistel cipher has a typical structure that any implementation should use, but it is up to you to choose and implement the following components of the cipher:
* Block size
* Key size
* Number of rounds
* Subkey generation algorithm
* Round function

We implemented the TEA, XTEA and XXTEA algorithms in Java
